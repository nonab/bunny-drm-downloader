# Bunny CDN DRM Video Downloader

A command-line tool to automatically download videos hosted on Bunny CDN (DRM-protected and not).

This script automates the process by visiting a webpage, extracting the `.m3u8` playlist, checks if video is encrypted and if it is, extracts the decryption key, and then uses `N_M3U8DL-RE` to download the video.

## Features

-   **Automatic Extraction**: Automatically finds the encryption key and playlist URL from a given webpage.
-   **Download**: The primary function is to download videos directly.
-   **Print-Only Mode**: Includes a `--print-only` flag to generate and display download commands without executing them (a "dry run").
-   **Batch Processing**: Accepts a single URL or a text file containing multiple URLs (one per line).
-   **Prerequisite Check**: Verifies that the `N_M3U8DL-RE` downloader is installed and accessible before starting.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.7+**
2.  **pip** (Python's package installer)
3.  **N\_M3U8DL-RE**: This is the core downloader used by the script.
    -   Download the latest release from the [N\_m3u8DL-RE GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-RE/releases).
    -   Place the executable in a folder that is included in your system's **PATH** environment variable.
4.  **FFmpeg**: `N_M3U8DL-RE` requires FFmpeg to merge the downloaded video and audio segments into a single file.
    -   Download the latest version from the official [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    -   Like the downloader, ensure the `ffmpeg` executable is also placed in a folder that is part of your system's **PATH**.
       

## Installation

1.  **Clone or Download**:
    Save the Python script (`bunny_grabber.py`) into a new folder.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd bunny-drm-downloader
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install Python Packages**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```sh
    pip install playwright
    ```

5.  **Install Chromium**:
    Playwright requires a browser binary to operate. Run the following command to install firefox.
    ```sh
    playwright install firefox
    ```

## Usage

The script can be run with a single URL or a path to a text file.

### To Download Videos (Default)

-   **From a single URL**:
    ```sh
    python bunny_grabber.py "https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/00000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)"
    ```

-   **From a file containing multiple URLs**:
    Create a file (e.g., `links.txt`) with one URL on each line.
    ```sh
    python bunny_grabber.py links.txt
    ```

### To Print Commands Without Downloading (`--print-only`)

-   **From a single URL**:
    ```sh
    python bunny_key_grabber.py --print-only "https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/00000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)"
    ```

-   **From a file**:
    ```sh
    python bunny_key_grabber.py --print-only links.txt
    ```
